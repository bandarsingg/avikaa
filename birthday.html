                <p>Hi love,
I just want you to know that I‚Äôm really grateful to have you in my life. You‚Äôre the most beautiful girl I have ever seen in my whole life, fr. You‚Äôre literally so pretty, oh god, I love you. I think about you all day. I still don't know how an imbecile like me pulled an angel like you.
YOU'RE LITERALLY THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME, AND I MEAN IT.
I love everything about you ‚Äî I love the way you giggle, I love when you get mad at me, I love when you tell me about your day, I love when we say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to each other. It‚Äôs just sad that I have to be this far away from you.
List of things I wanna do when we meet each other:
1. I want to ask you for a real date.
2. Click some pictures of you, then click some pictures of us. It would be really nice, wouldn‚Äôt it?
3. When it‚Äôs time to leave, I want to hug you and tell you that I‚Äôll be back soon to meet you again.

I think about us all day. Trust me when I say this, I‚Äôm gonna meet you soon. I‚Äôm really working my ass off to meet you ASAP. It‚Äôll be worth it.

I really want us to work out, you know. I know it sounds so cringe, but I really mean it. I don‚Äôt want you to be with anyone else but with me.

I LOVE YOU. YOU MAKE ME THE HAPPIEST.
Thank you for always looking after me. I know I don‚Äôt thank you enough, and I know I act like a complete dumb fuck sometimes ‚Äî please bear with me. I‚Äôm sorry if I ever hurt you. I didn‚Äôt mean to do it. I promise to not go overboard with my feelings. I‚Äôd never hurt you.

AVIKA, THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK.
I really missed you ever since you left. It was so hard for me to process things. I was thinking about you the whole year.
I‚Äôm sorry for being such a mess before. I really love you, I do. And it really breaks my heart imagining letting you go again. I‚Äôd never let you leave me again.

I WANT YOU WITH ME. YOU COMPLETE ME.
You actually make me feel like I‚Äôm worthy of being loved. Everything you have done for me I‚Äôll be forever grateful to you.

I really look forward to us. I want us to work out. IDC if it‚Äôs an LDR or whatever I want you.
I LOVE YOU.</p>

                <p>I hope you liked this. It's not that great, but I tried my best. Ugh, it's so hard to put feelings into words. I hope you have a great day, and please don't cry or get emotional on your birthday.

Send me fit checks üòò
HAPPY BIRTHDAY ONCE AGAIN
